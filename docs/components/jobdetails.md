url = "/job/:job_slug"
layout = "default"
description = "This page displays a single job with a application form"
is_hidden = 0

[jobDetails]
applicationSuccessMessage = "Thank you for applying for the job. We will get back to you shortly"

    {% flash success %}
        <div class="alert alert-success">{{ message }}</div>
    {% endflash %}
